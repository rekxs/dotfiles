# My Xmonad Conf (xmonad.hs) 
## My Keybindings

The MODKEY is set to the Super key (aka the Windows key).  I try to keep the
keybindings consistent with all of my window managers.

| Keybinding | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `MODKEY + RETURN` | opens terminal (alacritty is the terminal but can be easily changed) |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + RETURN` | opens run launcher (dmenu is the run launcher but can be easily changed) |
| `MODKEY + TAB` | rotates through the available layouts |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + c` | closes window with focus |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + r` | restarts xmonad |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + q` | quits xmonad |
| `MODKEY + 1-9` | switch focus to workspace (1-9) |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + 1-9` | send focused window to workspace (1-9) |
| `MODKEY + j` | windows focus down (switches focus between windows in the stack) |
| `MODKEY + k` | windows focus up (switches focus between windows in the stack) |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + j` | windows swap down (swap windows in the stack) |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + k` | windows swap up (swap the windows in the stack) |
| `MODKEY + h` | shrink window (decreases window width) |
| `MODKEY + l` | expand window (increases window width) |
| `MODKEY + w` | switches focus to monitor 1 |
| `MODKEY + e` | switches focus to monitor 2 |
| `MODKEY + r` | switches focus to monitor 3 |
| `MODKEY + period` | switch focus to next monitor |
| `MODKEY + comma` | switch focus to prev monitor |
